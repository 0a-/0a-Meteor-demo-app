             "content": "A <i>JavaScript closure</i> is not really <a class=\"default_anchor\" href=\"http://0ar.ch/\">a</a> thing. It is just a term we use to describe what happens when we have a function that has access to outside variables other functions cannot access.\n\n<blockquote>Outside variables are sometimes referred to as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-local_variable\">non-local variable.</a></blockquote>\n\nHere is a simple example of Javascipt closure.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nfunction cat(){\n\n\tvar nyan = \"meow\";\n\n\tfunction speak(){\n\n\t\talert(nyan);\n\n\t}\n\n\tspeak();\n\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\nNow everytime you call <code>cat()</code>, a new variable, <code>nyan</code>, would be created. And <code>nyan</code> is only accessible by the <code>speak();</code> function inside <code>cat()</code>.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\ncat(); //alerts \"meow\" because speak() is called\n\nalert(nyan); //error: nyan is undefined\n</pre></div>\n\n\nHere is another example of closure.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nfunction cat(){\n\n\tvar nyan = [\"meow\",\"I am a cat\"];\n\n\tvar x = 0;\n\n\tvar speak_and_change_x =  function(){\n\n\t\talert(nyan[x]);\n\n\t\tx = (x+1===2)? 0 : 1;\n\n\t};\n\n\treturn speak_and_change_x ;\n\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\nNow when you call <code>cat()</code>, 3 varialbes will be created: an array <code>nyan</code>, an integer <code>x</code>, and a function <code>speak_and_change_x</code>. Both <code>nyan</code> and <code>x</code> can only be accessed by function <code>speak_and_change_x()</code> inside <code>cat()</code>.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\ncat(); //nothing will be alerted.\n\ncat()(); //alert \"meow\";\n</pre></div>\n\n\nSince you are just returning <code>speak_and_change_x</code>, rather than calling it using <code>()</code>, nothing will be alerted when you call <code>cat()</code>. However, calling <code>cat()()</code> will <code>alert (\"meow\")</code> because it is equivalent to calling <code>speak_and_change_x()</code>.\n\nRather than writing <code>cat()()</code> to call the function, normally what we do is to store what <code>cat()</code> returns into a variable.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nvar Archy = cat(); //since cat() returns speak_and_change_x, Archy is now speak_and_change_x;\n\n//now calling Archy() will be the same as calling speak_and_change_x()\n\nArchy(); //alerts \"meow\"\n\nArchy(); //alerts \"I am a cat\"\n\nArchy(); //alerts \"meow\"\n\nArchy(); //alerts \"I am a cat\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\nNote: when returning a function, you shouldn't put <code>()</code> behind it. The moment you put <code>()</code> behind a function, you are calling/invoking it.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nvar a = function (){ return 6 };\n\nvar b = a(); //b is 6.\n\nalert(b); //6 will be alerted;\n\nalert(b()); //error: b is not a function\n\nvar c = a; //c is a function\n\nalert(c); //the entire function will be alearted\n\nalert(c()); //alert 6.\n</pre></div>\n\n<a onclick=\"var c = function (){ return 6 }; alert(c)\">Click here</a> if you are curious what calling <code>alert(c)</code> will look like in the code above.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"> ● ● ● </p>\n\n<h3>Bonus: Ternary Operator</h3>\nIn the example above you can see that I am doing something like this:  \n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nx = (x+1 === 2)? 0 : 1;</pre></div>\n\nThis is a short way of writing\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js nobr\">\nif( x+1 === 2 ){\n\tx = 0;\n}else{\n\tx = 1;\n}</pre></div>\n\nThe way it works can be visitualized in this form:\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nx = (condition)? if true : if false;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h3>Bonus: Strict Comparison Operators (<code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>)</h3>\n\nThe <code>===</code> in the code above is known as a Strict Comparison Operator. It is slightly different from <code>==</code>. When we compare two variables like this: <code>a === b</code>, the JavaScript engine will first look at the variables' <i>types</i>, and if they are not the same <i>type</i>, <code>false</code> will be returned immediately. \n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\n(0 === null) //false; \n\n(0 === \"0\") //false;\n\n(0 === []) //false; \n\n(0 === 0) //true;\n</pre></div>\n\n\nHowever, if we compare two varialbes using <code>==</code>, a type convertion would happen before the actual comparsion occurs.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\n(0 == null) //true; because JS engine has convereted null into integer 0\n\n(0 == \"0\") //true; because JS engine has converted the string \"0\" into integer 0\n\n(0 == []) //true; because JS engine has converted the empty array [] into integer 0 \n\n(0 == 0) //true;\n</pre></div>\n\n\nTherefore, in terms of performance, <code>===</code> would be slightly faster. The other strict comparison operator is <code>!==</code>, which is simply the inverse of <code>===</code>.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\n(0 !== 0) //false;\n\n(0 !== null) //true;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"> ● ● ● </p>\n\n(Now back to <a class=\"default_anchor\" href=\"http://0ar.ch/0a-explains-javascript-closure-and-design-patterns\">JavaScript closure</a>)\nWhen you create a closure, instead of returning a function, you can return an object. \n\nHere is another example of closure.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint nobr\">\nvar Archy = (function(){\n\tvar nyan = [\"meow\",\"I am a cat\"];\n\tvar x = 0;\n\tvar a =  function(){\n\t\talert(nyan[x]);\n\t};\n\tvar b = function(){\n\t\tx = (x+1===2)? 0 : 1;\n\t};\n\treturn {\n\t\tspeak: a,\n\t\ttransform: b,\n\t\tname: \"Archy\"\n\t}\n})();\n</pre></div>\n\n\nIn the example above, by returning an object, you will be able to return 2 functions that can access <code>nyan</code> and <code>x</code>, which other functions has no access to.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nalert(nyan[x]); //nyan is undefined, x is undefined.\n\nArchy.speak() //alerts \"meow\"\n\nArchy.speak() //alerts \"meow\"\n\nArchy.transform() //this changes the value of x that Archy.speak() has access to.\n\nArchy.speak() //alerts \"I am a cat\", because x has been changed to 1.\n\nalert(Archy.name); //alerts \"Archy\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\nFunctions in the form <code>function(){...}</code> is known as anonymous function. One cool thing in JavaScript is that functions are actually not required to have names.\n\nBy having a function like this <code>(function(){...})()</code> (enclosing it with brackets and putting another pair of brackets behind), we are basically calling this anonymous function. The <code>()</code> behind can also be used to pass parameters into the function, just like what can be done using the <code>()</code> behind a function name (i.e. <code>alert(\"nyan\")</code> ).\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n(function(){ alert(\"x\") })(); //alert \"x\"\n\n(function(a){ alert(a) })(\"x\"); //alert \"x\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<strike>What is interesting about enclosing a function with brackets is that the function would not have access to any variable outside unless the variable is passed into it as parameter.</strike> One common practice in Javascript is to pass commonly used variables into anonymous function as parameters for quicker access. By passing a variable into a function, you would be able to access it locally instead of globally when you are inside the function, and thus it would be relatively faster.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n(function(){ console.log(window); })(); //accessing global variable.\n\n(function(window){console.log(window); })(window); //accessing local variable.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\nWhen you surround <i>statements</i> (i.e. a function statement: <code>function hi(){}</code>) in brackets, you are turning them into <i>expressions</i> (in this case it is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression\">immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)</a>) and you can do all sort of things with expressions, similar to how you can do all sorts of things with variables.\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-js\">\nvar d = 1 < 0; //d has a boolean value of false.\n\nd.toString(); //d has been converted into a string.\n\nalert(d); //alerts \"false\"\n\nvar a = (1 < 0).toString(); //(1< 0) is being interpreted as an expression.\n\nalert(a); //alerts \"false\";\n\n(function hi(){alert(a)}).call(); //alerts \"false\";\n\n(function hi(){alert(a)})(); //alerts \"false\";\n\nfunction hi(){alert(a)}.call(); //syntax error\n\nfunction hi(){alert(a)}(); //syntax error</pre></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"> ● ● ● </p>\n\n<h3>Now let's talk about  <a class=\"default_anchor\" href=\"http://0ar.ch/0a-explains-javascript-closure-and-design-patterns\">design patterns in JavaScript</a></h3>\n\nThe example above where we create a closure and return an object is actually an example of a design pattern in JavaScript known as The Module Pattern.\n\nThere are many design patterns in JavaScript. Different design patterns are just different ways of writing codes. The Module Pattern, for example, uses <a href=\"http://0ar.ch/0a-explains-javascript-closure-and-design-patterns\">closure</a> to create the illusion of a class object (or a class instance), something that JavaScript doesn't really provide (since JavaScript implements <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming\">prototype-based OO</a>).  Using The Module Pattern, one would be able to have <i>public</i> and <i>private</i> functions and variables in an object (as if it is an instance of a class in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming\">class-based OO</a>).\n\n<blockquote>\n\nIn this case, <code>x</code> and <code>nyan</code> are private variables, while <code>name</code> is a public variable and <code>speak()</code> and <code>transform()</code> are public functions. In class-based OO language, when something is public, it simply means that it is globally accessible. When something is private, only the instance and class functions (In this case there isn't a class function) are able to access it.\n\n</blockquote> \n\n\nNow let's move on to The Singleton Pattern, another beginner design pattern that makes good use of closure. The Singleton Pattern is like an upgrade version of The Module Pattern. Besides creating an illusion of a class object, it creates an illusion of a class function that either constructs the object (an instance of the class) or returns an already constructed object.\n\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint nobr\">\nvar Archy = (function(){\n\n\tfunction cat (obj){\n\t\tvar nyan = obj.nyan,\n\t\tx = obj.x;\n\t\tthis.speak = function(){\n\t\t\talert(nyan[x]);\n\t\t};\n\t\tthis.transform = function(){\n\t\t\tx = (x+1===2)? 0 : 1;\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n\tvar instance;\n\tvar _static = {\n\t\tname: \"Archy\",\n\t\tget_cat: function(obj){\n\t\tif(instance === undefined){\n\t\t\tinstance = new cat(obj);\n\t\t}else{\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"instance already created. nyannannn.\");\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn instance;\n\t\t} \n\t}\n\treturn _static;\n})();\n\nvar nyancat = Archy.get_cat({nyan: [\"meow\",\"I am a cat\"], x: 0}); //it creats an instance\nnyancat.speak(); //alerts \"meow\";\nnyancat.transform();\nnyancat.speak(); //alerts \"I am a cat\";\nvar mycat = Archy.get_cat(); //\"instance already created. nyannannn.\"\nmycat.speak(); //alerts \"I am a cat\";\n</pre></div>\n\n\nBasically, as we can see, we restrict instantiation of a class to a single object in The Singleton Pattern.\n\n(From the example above:)\n<div class=\"pretainer\"><pre class=\"prettyprint nobr\">\nvar instance;\nvar _static = {\n\t\tname: \"Archy\",\n\t\tget_cat: function(obj){\n\t\tif(instance === undefined){\n\t\t\tinstance = new cat(obj);\n\t\t}else{\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"instance already created. nyannannn.\");\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn instance;\n\t\t} \n\t}\n</pre></div>\n\n\nHere we can see that nothing will happen to the variable <code>instance</code>, which would be returned, if <code>instance</code> is not <code>undefined</code>.\n\nConclusion: in The Singleton Pattern, the object/instance can only be accessed using the <code>Archy.get_cat()</code> function. So Archy is acting like the agent of the cat. There is no other way to get the cat unless you ask  <a class=\"default_anchor\" href=\"http://0ar.ch/\">Archy</a>. And Archy would create the cat for you the first time you ask for the cat. After that Archy would just keep giving you the same old cat.\n\nThrrp.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">  - The End - </p>\n\n<blockquote>If you want to learn more about Javascript's design patterns, here is <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/\">a great book written by Addy Osmani</a>.</blockquote>",

Now and then, pairs of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle\">virtual particles</a> are produced in the vacuum near the event horizon due to a phenomenon known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation\">quantum fluctuation</a> that happens everywhere in this universe. In the usual case they will just <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation\">annihilate</a> each other and back to non-existence. But there are times when one of them falls into the black hole, while the other escapes as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation\">black body radiation</a> known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation\">Hawking radiation</a>. When this happens, the particle that falls into the black hole would appear to have negative energy. The creation of the particle pair requires energy. If they manage to annihilate each other within <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time\">Planck time</a>, they stay <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_state_(physics)\">\"virtual\"</a> throughout their existence. If one of them becomes \"real\", a nearby region with high energy potential would experience a decrease in energy. And thus a black hole shrinks over time and loses its energy (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence\">in the form of mass</a>). The total lifespan of a black hole of M solar masses is <a href=\"http://xaonon.dyndns.org/hawking/\">calculated</a> to be roughly 2 x 10<span class=\"sup\">67</span> M<span class=\"sup\">3</span> years, which is still pretty long.\n\nHowever, according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hair_theorem\">no-hair theorem</a>, Hawking radiation appears contain information that depends only on the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole, unlike normal thermal radiation which contains information about the body. It is as if information about the particles that fall into balck hole is lost. This is how the black hole information paradox arises. Information conversation in the black hole scenario is currently an open question in the physics community. One famous solution is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle\">holographic principle</a> within the framework of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory\">string theory</a>.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2DIl3Hfh9tY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nWhen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity\">general relativity</a> (the theory that predicted the existence of black holes) meets <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">quantum mechanics</a>, we can see that there is something more about the fabric of space-time - something very fundamental about our universe - that we do not yet quite understand.

We would get $undefined$ when we put 3 into the function.\n\n$$f(3) = \\frac{(3^2-3 \\cdot 3)^2}{3-3} = undefined $$\n\nThis is also why there is a hole in the graph of $f(x)$.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/hole.png\"></p>\n\nBut looking at the graph, we can see that 0 is the expected value when $x$ approaches 3.\n\n$$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 3}f(x) = 0 $$\n\nTo compute the limit when the actual output is undefined, in normal case we simply need to simplify the algebraic expression to avoid division by 0. And then put the value $x$ is approaching into the function as $x$.\n\n$$\\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \\frac{x^4-6x^3+9x^2}{x-3} = \\frac{x^2(x-3)^2}{x-3} = x^2(x-3)$$\n\n$$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 3}\\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 3} x^2(x-3) = 3^2(3-3) = 0$$\n\n<blockquote>\n\nLimit can be viewed as the biggest/smallest impossible number for a function to output, when you put in numbers that are slightly smaller or bigger than what x is approaching.\n\nTake the limit above for example:\n\n$$\\begin{align}f(x) &= \\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} \\\\\\\\\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 3}f(x) &= 0 \\end{align}$$\n\n0 is the <u>smallest impossible number</u> for $f(x)$ to output if $f(x)$ takes in values <u>slightly smaller</u> than 3.\n\n$$\\begin{align}f(2.99999) &= -0.0000899994 \\\\f(2.9999999) &= -0.000008999994000001 \\end{align}$$\n\nNo matter how close the input is to 3, as long as it is smaller than 3, it is impossible for the function to output 0 or any number bigger than 0.

And a derivative is a function that gives you the \"slope\" (or rate of change) of another function at a certain point.\n\nBasically, differentiation can be seen as a machine that takes in a function and gives you back another function.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/d_machine.png\"></p>\n\nWe all know that the slope of a linear equation/function has a constant value. It has the same rate of change at every point on the line. So the graph of a linear equation/function is indeed a straight line. \n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/linear.png\"></p>\n\nFor every value of 1 added to the input, a value of the slope (in this case, 4) would be added to the output.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/linear2.png\"></p>\n\nThe change between input and output is always in the ratio of 1 to $m$, where $m$ is the value for the slope. Adding 0.1 to the input will trigger a change of $+0.1m$ in the output, etc.\n\n$$\\begin{align}f(5)&=8 \\\\\\\\f(6) &= f(5) + 1 \\times 4 = 12 \\\\\\\\f(5.1) &= f(5)+0.1\\times 4 = 8.4 \\\\\\\\f(5.02) &= f(5)+0.02 \\times 4 = 8.08 \\end{align}$$\n\nBut this is only true for linear function. For functions that are not linear, every point doesn't have a constant rate of change. Take a look at the function $f(x)=2^x$.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/nonlinear.png\"></p>\n\n$$\\begin{align}f(3)&=8 \\\\\\\\f(4)&=16 \\\\\\\\f(5)&=32 \\\\\\\\ f(6)&=64 \\\\\\\\ f(7)&=128 \\end{align}$$\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/well.png\"></p>\n\nThis is when we cannot use a constant to represent the \"slope\": we need to use a function that gives us different \"slope\" (rate of change) at different point. Or rather, we shouldn't even call it a \"slope\" anymore since the rate of change is not constant. We call it derivative. \n\n<small>\nIf you are still trying to get your head around what it means by \"the rate of change is not constant\", imagine a cat at rest starts to accelerate constantly at $1m/s^2$. Three seconds later it would be moving at the speed of $3m/s$. So far the rate of change in its speed is constant. But when the cat begins to slow down, the rate of change would no longer be constant.\n</small>\n\n<h3 class=\"_index\">How to find the derivative of a function?</h3>\nThe rate of change at a certain point in the function can be visualized as a straight line across the point.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/nonlinear2.png\"></p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThis is normally called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent\">tangent line at a certain point</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\nSince a non-linear function doesn't have a constant rate of change, it means that every point of the function needs a different straight line to represent the rate of change.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/nonlinear3.png\"></p>\n\nTo find the derivative of a function is to find another function that will output a value at every point, which can be represented by a corresponding straight line.\n\n<blockquote>\nThe rate of change at point $x$ is therefore sometimes also known as the derivative at point $x$.\n</blockquote>\n\nTo get the straight line that represents the derivative at a certain point, one way to do it is to first locate 2 different points on the graph and draw a line across them.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/draw_a_straight_line.png\"></p>\n\n<blockquote>\nSome people refer to this line as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line\">secant line</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis line represents a value. It represents the rate of change if the 2 points belong to a linear function.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/belong.png\"></p>\n\nBut now this function is not linear. So this line is not accurate at all if we try to use it to represent the rate of change at any one of the 2 points. \n\nApparently, the closer the 2 points are, the more accurate the line is in representing the rate of change at any one point.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/dot_closer.png\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/dot_closer2.png\"></p>\n\nWith that in mind, let's start off with a line that cuts across 2 points (A and B), and shift the line accordingly as we shift B towards A along the graph. By the time B is at the same point as A, we would have a line that can accurately represent the rate of change at point A - we would have a line that represents the derivate of the function at point A.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/dot_closer.gif\"></p>\n\nBy turning the process above into a function (denoted by $f'(x)$), this function would be the derivative of the function of the graph (denoted by $f(x)$).\n\n$$\\begin{align}slope &=  \\frac{y_B-y_A}{x_B-x_A}\\\\\\\\f'(x) &= \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}\\end{align}$$\n\nHere we are denoting the coordinate of point B as $(x+h, f(x+h))$. And what we are doing is obtaining a value for the straight line (the \"slope\"/derivative) at point A as we shift point B to A by making $h$ approach 0.  So the coordinate becomes $(x+0, f(x+0))$, which is the coordinate for point A.\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/assets/img/dot_closer2.gif\"></p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThis is the modern definition of derivative in terms of limit.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nBesides $f'(x)$ <sub>[aka Lagrange's notation]</sub>, here is another common notation for differentiation:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz\">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, a great German mathematician, came up with this notation in the 17th century when he was still alive. He came up with it by seeing $dx$ as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal\">infinitesimal (infinitely small)</a> change in $x$ [the input of $f(x)$]. And the single $d$ at the numerator here is supposed to be merged with $f(x)$ to indicate an infinitesimal change in $f(x)$ [the output of $f(x)$]. $\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ is sometimes written as $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, where $y$ stands for the output of $f(x)$. \n\nThis is actually a more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_non-standard_analysis\">ancient</a> way of defining a derivative: a derivative tells you the rate of change of the output at an infinitesimal scale as the input changes. Therefore it is $dy$ [or $d\\ f(x)$] divided by $dx$ - an infinitesimal change in $f(x)$, divided by an infinitesimal change in $x$. So we are defining derivative in terms of a fraction ($\\frac{dy}{dx}$) here, instead of a limit.\n\nWe call this way of thinking about derivative <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis\">non-standard analysis</a>.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nLet's say we want to get the derivative of $x^3$.

So what we normally do is to find the indefinite integral first before putting $a$ and $b$ into the indefinite integral and getting the difference between them (using the definition of definite integral from the 2nd fundamental theorem of calculus mentioned above).\n\n$$g(x) = x^4 \\\\ \\int g(x)\\ dx =\\frac{x^5}{5} + C \\\\ \\int_2^3 g(x)\\ dx = \\frac{3^5}{5}-\\frac{2^5}{5} = 42.2 $$ \n\nOf course, it is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/q/710175/65082\">not always necessary to get the indefinite integral first (it is possible to arrive at an answer after some transformations of the definite integral)</a>. \n\n<h3 class=\"_index\">How to find the indefinite integral (anti-derivative) of a function?</h3>\nApparently, we can reverse the differentiation shortcuts/rules above and turn them into integration shortcuts/rules. But sometimes a little bit of creativity is required for integration. Let's take a look at the reverse-<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule\">chain-rule</a>.\n\n$$ f'(g(x))g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))$$\n\nThings don't always come in a perfect bundle. To use reverse-chain-rule, most of the time we need to see the algebraic structure as $f'(g(x))$ and compute $g'(x)$ on our own.\n\n$$f'(g(x)) = \\frac{1}{g'(x)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))$$\n\nHere is an example. Let's say we need to solve this indefinite integral.\n\n$$\\int \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx$$\n\nWe can see $f'(x)$ as $\\frac{3}{x^2}$ and $g(x)$ as $2x+1$. \n\n$$\\int \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx = \\int f'(g(x)) dx$$\n\nWhat we need to do now is to obtain $f(x)$ by integrating $f'(x)$, and obtain $g'(x)$ by differentiating $g(x)$.\n\n$$f(x) = \\int f'(x)\\ dx = \\int \\frac{3}{x^2} \\ dx= \\frac{-3}{x}$$\n\n$$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} 2x+1 = 2$$\n\n$$\\begin{align}\\int \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx&= \\frac{1}{g'(x)} \\cdot f'(g(x)) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{-3}{2x+1} + C \\end{align}$$\n\nSo if we need to solve the definite integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx$, we just put the two values into the indefinite integral and get the difference like this:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\\int_a^b \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\\ dx &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{-3}{2 \\cdot b +2} - \\frac{-3}{2 \\cdot a +2}) \\\\\\\\ \\int_0^1 \\frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\\ dx &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\frac{-3}{2 \\cdot 1 +2} - \\frac{-3}{2 \\cdot 0 +2}) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1 \\end{align}$$\n\n<blockquote>\nThis technique (reversing chain rule) is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution\">integration by substitution</a>, or, $u$-substitution, where $g(x)$ is often written as $u$.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThe truth is: finding an indefinite integral can be really hard sometimes. Aside from the fact that there isn't an \"absolute\" way of humanly doing it, there is actually a rigorous mathematical reason behind it. The set of functions we humans love to do differentiation on is normally closed under differentiation. This means if we differentiate a function, we should anticipate to get back a similar function (e.g. differentiating  an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function\">elementary function</a> gives us back an elementary function). But it is not the case for integration. It is possible to integrate an elementary function, and get a non-elementary function in return (e.g $\\int e^{x^2} dx$ ). \nAnd as we can see, definite integration is more of a local operation, while indefinite integration is a global operation. This is why sometimes it makes more sense to solve a definite integral using transformations and techniques, arriving at the answer without having to compute the indefinite integral. There are respected individuals (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/users/19661/vladimir-reshetnikov\">Vladimir Reshetnikov</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/users/97378/cleo\">Cleo</a> on Maths StackExchange) who are amazingly good at it.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"> ● ● ● </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"_index\">Bonus: Partial derivative</h3>\n\nWhen a function has more than one input value, we call it a multivariable function.\n\n$$f(x_1,x_2) = 3x_1+x_2$$\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThe graphs of functions that take in 1 input are lines in a 2D plane, while the graphs of functions that take in 2 inputs are surfaces in a 3D space, etc.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nTo differentiate functions like this, we find the derivative with respect to one of the variables (denoted by $x_i$ in this case). This type of derivative is known as a partial derivative.\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)$$\n\nFinding a partial derivative is very similar to finding a normal derivative: we get the limit as x approaches 0. But instead of having just $f(x+a)-f(x)$, we have $f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)$, since the function takes in more than one input.\n\n$$\\begin{align}&\\ \\ \\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n) \\\\ &= \\lim_{a\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)}{(x_i+a)-x_i}\\end{align}$$\n\nTo do a partial differentiation, we simply pretend that other variables in the function are constants as we differentiate the function with respect to the chosen input. Here is an example.\n\n$$\\begin{align}f(x,a,b,c) &= x^5+2ax+10b^{9}+log_{a}(c) \\\\\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,a,b,c) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^5+2ax+10C^{9}+log_{C}(C)) \\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^5+2Cx+C) \\\\ &= 5x^4+2C \\\\ &= 5x^4+2a  \\end{align}$$\n\n<small>added on 29th Oct, at 5PM (SG Timezone, +8): \n[edited a couple of times around 8 30PM to express the idea of tangent space in a more clear and concise way. And corrected some mistakes I made in the analogy of tangent plane.]\n</small>\nUpon differentiating the function, we need to replace the remaining $C$ back with the corresponding variables.\n\n$$\\begin{align} g(x,a,b,c) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,a,b,c)  \\\\ &= 5x^4+2C = 5x^4+2a \\end{align}$$\n\nBasically, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,a,b,c)$ tells you about how an infinitesimal change in the input $x$ would affect the output $f(x,a,b,c)$ when $a$, $b$ and $c$ remains unchangeable. To get the numerical value for the derivative, it is sometimes necessary to put an actual value into these variables. \n\n$$\\begin{align} g(1,2,0,0) &= 629 \\\\g(1,3,0,0) &= 631 \\end{align}$$\n\nThe derivative of functions with 1 input at one point ($x,f(x)$) can be represented by a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentLine.html\">tangent lines</a> when $x$ is specified. Meanwhile, the representation for the derivative of functions with 2 inputs at points($x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2)$) where $x_1$ is specified is a plane (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentPlane.html\">tangent plane</a>), for functions with 3 input it is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space\"> 3D space</a> (3D <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space\">tangent space</a>), etc.\n\n<blockquote>\n\nIn normal differentiation (single-input functions). To obtain a numerical value for the rate of change at a certain point is to obtain the slope of the tangent line at that point: there is only 1 slope because there is only one single line going across one single <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)\">point</a>, $(x,f(x))$. To do it we just need to specify $x$ since $f(x)$ is only dependent on $x$.\n\nThe graph of a two-variable function is a 2 dimensional surface in 3 dimensional space, so each point can be represented by $(x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2))$, where the value of $f(x_1,x_2)$ is dependent to both $x_1$ and $x_2$. \n\nThe derivative with respect to any one of the variable (e.g. $x_1$) when the variable (this case, $x_1$) is specific is a value dependent to $f(x_1,x_2)$ and $x_2$. So it is no longer a tangent line across one point, but a tangent plane across infinitely many points whose $x_1 = \\text{the specific value}$. This is why, if we want to get an actual numerical value for the slope, we need to specify $x_2$.\n \nThe same applies to tangent of higher dimensions.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"> - The End - </p>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf you are really interested in learning more about calculus, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1\">Calculus One</a> by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/instructor/jimfowler\">Jim Fowler</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://coursera.com/\">Coursera</a>.
